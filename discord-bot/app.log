 It can be that or another type of error happened! Tell me on github: https://github.com/MirageZoe/ 
 Everything happened on Tuesday, 5/19/2020 at 16:07:52 PM with message:

`ReportChannel.send is not a function`

 *P.S: If this is the first time getting something like this, most likely because it was not set up good the log channel at beginning and didn't know where to send the reports. Do not panic, next time it will work since he created the channel where to send the reports!*
